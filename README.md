## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher

### üì¶ Required Python Libraries

- `google-generativeai`
- `SpeechRecognition`
- `pyttsx3`

---

## üîê Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Run the following commands in your terminal:
     
     ```bash
     git clone <your-repo>   # Replace <your-repo> with GitHub repository link
     cd <your-repo-folder>   # Replace <your-repo-folder> with your project folder name
     ```
     
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   - Run the following line in your terminal which will create a virtual environment named `myenv`:
     
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv myenv
     ```
     
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - On macOS/Linux:
     
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
     
   - On Windows:
     
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
    
4. **Install Dependencies**
   - If you'd prefer to install all required packages at once, you can use the provided `requirements.txt` file:
     
     ```bash
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     
   **(Alternative Method for step 4)**:
   - Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages:
   - For `google-generativeai`:
     
     ```bash
     pip3 install google-generativeai
     ```
     
   - For `SpeechRecognition`:
     
     ```bash
     pip3 install SpeechRecognition
     ```
     
   - For `pyttsx3`:
     
     ```bash
     pip3 install pyttsx3
     ```
     
5. **Google Generative AI API Key and Model**

   - For API Key: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) to get your API key.
   - Replace the placeholder in the code with your key:
     
     ```python
     API_KEY = 'Your_API_Key'
     ```
     
   - For Model: If you want to use a different model than the default (`gemini-pro`), you can:
   - Visit the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) to browse and select the model that best suits your needs.
   - Copy the model name and in your code, update the line:
     ```python
     model = ai.GenerativeModel("your-model-name")  # Replace the model name you have copied
     ```
     
   ***‚ö†Ô∏è Note:***
   - Google provides a free tier for Generative AI with limited monthly usage.
   - If you exceed the free quota or use premium models, charges may apply.
   - Use Responsibly, stay within free limits and avoid unexpected charges.
